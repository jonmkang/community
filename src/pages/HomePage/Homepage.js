                    Chances are, if you found yourself here, you are connected to me in some way, shape or form!
                    You see, I found it really hard to connect to people when I moved to NYC because there is always so much to remember about everyone I have ever met.
                    I was a bartender and to be honest, meeting hundreds of different people every day made it very hard for me to save all the details of people in my tiny brain.
                    In Community, you'll be able to see people in the community groups I am creating for my friends and their friends!
                    I am encouraging my friends to add in whatever information about themselves as they want.
                    Maybe eventually we can leave positive notes on the community board so we can get to know each other better!
